            Eating local is a growing movement in many areas with the sudden re-popularity of community food events like Farmer’s Markets and local vendors working with grocers as is seen in many Food Cooperatives.
            For our project we decided to look at some of the differences and benefits between eating local and some of the other conventual
            methods as well as how people can potentially work to support, supply or bolster this movement within their communities.

                <h2 class="c">The Benefits &amp; Differences of Eating Local</h2>
                <p>
                    Where do you buy your food? Do you grow it in your own garden, purchase it from a farmer, a local supermarket, or a grocery store,
                    or do you go buy food at a fast food chain or restaurant? There are many options to buying food, yet some are overlooked more than others.
                    Buying local foods for instance is something commonly done when one has the time to go to a farmer's market or the local supermarket a couple times a week.
                    Many find this practice inconvenient especially when one can go to the grocery store and find whatever item they are looking for even when it is not in season.
                    There are however, many other differences between eating local foods versus the other options that many people often overlook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Local foods are defined as products grown 100 miles from where you live and purchased from farmers or local supermarkets.
                    This being, local foods not only help the environment but also one’s personal health. In 2005, imports made up 15% of all the food consumed in the United States.
                    That is a large carbon footprint being left behind when an average food item may travel 1,200-4,800 miles in the United States alone before reaching a kitchen table.
                    Since food production relies heavily on energy and oil, local foods do not have to travel very long distances before reaching a local supermarket.
                    This helps support the environment as local foods help maintain farmland and green area. In addition, when buying local foods at the farmers market,
                    one helps support the local economy by keeping the money in the community. The more food farmers are able to sell, the more they will be able to contribute to other aspects of the community.
                    Farmers need to make a living too. This is done many times through connections. Local foods create a great community to get to know the people who sell and harvest the food.
                    There is no better way to understand where your food came from and how it was harvested than by talking to the person who grew it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, imported foods that are traveling so far to reach your kitchen table do not only hurt the environment, 
                    but can be a risk to your health since chemicals and additives have been put in the food to make them stay fresher much 
                    longer than they naturally would. According to the book Environmental Health by Kathryn Hilgenkamp, there are over 2,8000 different
                    additives included in foods to modify them in one way or another such as overall appearnace or flavor <cite>(Hilgenkamp, 2006)</cite>.
                    In addition, these 
                    imported foods have a chance of being contaminated during the food production process before reaching your table.
                    Most imported foods are stored in storage areas before finding themselves on shelves in stores and may lose nutrients 
                    as it deteriorates over time. However, local foods are usually picked 24 hours before purchase meaning they taste better, 
                    are fresher, seasonal, and contain more nutrients. Within three days of harvests, most produce lose up to 30% of its nutrients. 
                    In an article published by the Chicago Tribune, they cited a study from the University of California that found 
                    vegetables could lose anywhere from 15-55% of vitamin C within a week of harvest <cite>(Eng, 2013)</cite>. 
                    Often times chemicals are used to preserve fresh produce when it needs to be stored elsewhere. The chemicals and pesticides added to the food can cause pollution in the environment and are a risk to one’s health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, these are not the only differences to be aware of when considering whether to eating local foods.  This brings us to the next
                    topic we will cover, the cost.

                </p>

            <div class="content noshow">
                <h2 class="c">Price Comparisions</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The standard held conception is that eating local and organic is more expensive and often we do little to quest that narrative.
                        We decided to actually visit the source and do a side by side comparison where we could to determine the validity of said conception.
                        We started off by visiting Just Local Food.  There I spoke with Cody Maciosek and Mattie Kahn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before getting to that discussion we should discuss some other critical factors to this topic.
                        Foremost amongst these is our local hardiness zone of 4b per the USDA’s website on growing zones <cite>(USDA, 2012)</cite>
                        .
                        This means that by using conventional farming methods the typical growing season is limited by frost dates.
                        This typically means that the season is restricted to roughly the range of May 6th – October 2nd according to the Farmer’s Almanac website
                        <cite>(Yankee Publishing, Inc., 2017)</cite>.  Because of this the variety of crops and amount are limited to what can be grown within this timeframe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that being said we can move back to our interview with Cody Macoisek and Mattie Kahn.  Just Local Food is a Co-op and as such is dependent on suppliers to the co-op <cite>
                            (Maciosek, 2018)
                        </cite>.
                        During the growing season of their products will be that provided by the area producers.  However, as a necessity during the winter they function much like a traditional grocery store
                        for produce <cite>(Kahn, 2018)</cite>. With that being said we can’t compare prices on produce because for the most part it simply isn’t available at the time of writing (1.15.18).
                        However, I will say from personal experience the Farmer’s Market prices during the season are typically lower than those of comparable products at the major local grocers.
                        So, without a further ado lets look at some examples of products where we can draw a price comparison.
                        For these comparisons we will use the local Woodmans as our representation of the major grocery chains in our area.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <div class="flex">
                            <img src="images/jlf.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                            <img src="images/w.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Prices for Just Local Food will be displayed on the left while prices for
                            Woodman's will be displayed on the right just like the pictures above.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Eggs</h3>
                    <div class="flex">
                        <img src="images/jlfeggs.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                        <img src="images/weggs.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                    </div>
                    <p>Here we see Woodman’s is significantly higher in quantity and lower in price by $1.12 when comparing the two 12 count
                    cartons.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Milk</h3>
                    <div class="flex">
                        <img src="images/jlfmilk.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                        <img src="images/wmilk.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                    </div>
                    <p>In this case we see that Woodman’s is ahead in the price category in the range of $1.70-1.90 cheaper. It should be noted
                    that both locations do offer the $1.50 bottle deposit as well.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Lettuce</h3>
                    <div class="flex">
                        <img src="images/jlflettuce.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                        <img src="images/wlettuce.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                    </div>
                    <p>This is one of the few produce items comparable due to non-traditional hydroponic growing available in our area.
                    Yet still we see a price lead by Woodman’s here as well to the tune of .75&cent; for an identical item.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Whole Chicken</h3>
                    <div class="flex">
                        <img src="images/jlfchicken.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                        <img src="images/wchicken.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                    </div>
                    <p>In this case we see the same price is actually identical at both locations.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Pork Chops</h3>
                    <div class="flex">
                        <img src="images/jlfpork.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                        <img src="images/wpork.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                    </div>
                    <p>Again, Woodman’s ahead by a fair amount per pound, $2.60 per pound to be exact.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Ground Beef</h3>
                    <div class="flex">
                        <img src="images/jlfbeef.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                        <img src="images/wbeef.jpg" class="comparePrice" />
                    </div>
                    <p>Again, we see Woodman’s with the lower price point when compared to Just Local Food. In this case the difference is 
                    pretty significant as the price is $2.50 more, which is essentially double. But keep in mind that might not be an exact 1:1 
                    comparison as I was unable to determine the fat % content of the item at Just Local Food which is typipcally a strong price driver.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Now in these seven specific examples we see that prices typically favor the major grocers.
                        From a purely logical standpoint that makes sense on just a measure of scale.  Because the local grocers have higher volume they can afford lower margins on products and still turn a profit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How does fast food compare?  While this is certainly a case of comparing Apples to Oranges in a sense that we are looking at 
                        ingredients vs. a
                        finished product we can still do a quick glance to see if anything stands out.  Using a pricing chart provided by ResturantFoodMenu.com
                        we can see an example of a typical Culver's menu that we use to compare to.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/culvers.jpg" />
                        <p class="right"><cite>(Culver's Menu and Prices, 2018)</cite></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps the easiest comparison can be drawn on chicken prices.  Shopping at Just Local Foods we could purchase two whole chickens for the price of the smallest Chicken To Go order from Culvers and end up with vastly more food making Just Local Foods a clear winner there without even considering the added health benefits of avoiding fast food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seeing that, we can say that yes, the typical convention that eating local food does have a higher price point does hold true in the specific cases that we looked at today, but that should be taken with a number of caveats.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The price may be higher, but not prohibitory so.  Pork Chops for example, even at 6.99/lb. is only .67&cent; per serving more when you get 3 chops per pound. Meaning for a family of four which ate pork chops once a week for a month would cost only an additional $10.72 a month.</li>
                        <li>We are comparing during the off season which is a distinct disadvantage to local food options</li>
                        <li>These seven items might not be indicative of what you actually eat and thus are not a good representation of what your cost comparison might be.</li>
                        <li>
                            We are not being ultra specific with comparisions here.  We didn't measure items such as pork chop width, ground beef fat content percentage
                            or gross weights of similar sized salad containers.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        While the prices are certainly lower at major grocery chains, there are certainly other benifits associated with with eating local that work to ofset
                        some of that price difference.

                        You simply do not have that type of access at a major grocery chain.
                        Looking back at the interview with Mr. Maciosek and Mr. Kahn, I asked who the major demographic of the store was,
                        while they stated that many different groups were present, the vast majority of sales came from those who are more affluent <cite>
                            (Maciosek, 2018)
                        </cite>.
                        I think that is an interesting fact that should not be over looked.  When purchasing or spending power is not a concern these
                        folks choose to shop local and support the farmers and local grower’s movement in our community.  Perhaps in doing so the will
                        allow said farmers or others to eventually increase in scale or technology and drag the prices down while still maintaining the other positive environmental benefits of the movement.
